## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React]: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows creating reusable components that can handle state and interact with each other.
- [Context API]: A built-in feature of React that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props through every level of the tree. It is a simple and lightweight solution for small to medium-sized applications that do not require complex state management.
- [Bootstrap]: A CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap provides a set of predefined styles and components that can be easily customized and integrated with React.
- [React Bootstrap]: A library that combines Bootstrap components with React. React Bootstrap allows using Bootstrap components as React components and supports Bootstrap 4.
- [React Router]: A library that provides routing functionality for React applications. React Router enables navigation between different components based on the URL path.
- [TypeScript]: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features to the language. TypeScript helps you catch errors and bugs at compile time, rather than at runtime. It also improves the readability and maintainability of your code by enforcing type annotations and contracts.
